      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "*   **Good Model:** You study the practice questions, understand the underlying concepts, and can answer similar questions on the actual test, even if they are phrased slightly differently.\n",
      "*   **Overfitted Model:** You memorize the exact wording and answers of every single practice question. When you encounter a question on the test that is even slightly different, you're lost because you only learned the specific examples, not the general principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics of an Overfitted Model:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Excellent Performance on Training Data:** The model achieves very high accuracy, low error, or other desirable metrics on the data it was trained on.\n",
      "2.  **Poor Performance on Test/Unseen Data:** When presented with new data, the model's performance drops significantly. It makes many incorrect predictions.\n",
      "3.  **High Complexity:** Overfitted models often have a high degree of complexity. For example, a decision tree might have too many branches, or a neural network might have too many layers and neurons. This complexity allows it to capture even the smallest fluctuations in the training data.\n",
      "4.  **Sensitivity to Noise:** The model has learned the \"noise\" (random errors or irrelevant variations) in the training data as if it were a real pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Does Overfitting Happen?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several factors can contribute to overfitting:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Model Complexity:** Using a model that is too complex for the amount of data available. A very powerful model can easily \"memorize\" a small dataset.\n",
      "*   **Insufficient Training Data:** If the training dataset is too small, the model might not have enough examples to learn the true underlying patterns and instead focuses on the specific instances it has seen.\n",
      "*   **Training for Too Long:** In iterative learning algorithms (like neural networks), training for too many epochs can lead to overfitting. The model keeps adjusting its parameters to fit the training data better, eventually starting to fit the noise.\n",
      "*   **High Dimensionality:** When the number of features (variables) is much larger than the number of data points, it becomes easier for the model to find spurious correlations that don't generalize.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy: Drawing a Line Through Points**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a few data points scattered on a graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Underfitting:** You draw a straight line that doesn't capture the general trend of the points.\n",
      "*   **Good Fit:** You draw a smooth curve that follows the general trend of the points.\n",
      "*   **Overfitting:** You draw a wiggly line that goes through *every single point*, including any outliers or random deviations. This wiggly line will likely be very far off if you add a new point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Consequences of Overfitting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary consequence is that the model is **unreliable** in real-world applications. It might perform brilliantly in a controlled testing environment but fail miserably when deployed. This can lead to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Bad business decisions\n",
      "*   Incorrect diagnoses\n",
      "*   Flawed predictions\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Prevent or Mitigate Overfitting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, there are several techniques to combat overfitting:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **More Data:** The most effective solution is often to collect more diverse and representative training data.\n",
      "*   **Simpler Models:** Choose a model with less complexity (e.g., a linear model instead of a high-degree polynomial, a shallower decision tree).\n",
      "*   **Regularization:** Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty to the model's complexity, discouraging it from becoming too intricate.\n",
      "*   **Cross-Validation:** This technique involves splitting the training data into multiple folds and training the model on different combinations of these folds. It helps assess how well the model generalizes.\n",
      "*   **Early Stopping:** For iterative algorithms, monitor the model's performance on a separate validation set. Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the training set performance is still improving.\n",
      "*   **Feature Selection/Engineering:** Removing irrelevant features or creating more meaningful ones can simplify the problem for the model.\n",
      "*   **Dropout (for Neural Networks):** Randomly \"dropping out\" (ignoring) a fraction of neurons during training prevents them from becoming too co-dependent.\n",
      "*   **Data Augmentation:** Artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of existing data (e.g., rotating images, adding noise to audio).\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Overfitting is a common pitfall in machine learning where a model becomes too tailored to its training data, sacrificing its ability to perform well on new, unseen data. It's like a student who memorizes answers instead of understanding concepts. Recognizing and addressing overfitting is crucial for building robust and reliable machine learning systems.\n",

      "Okay, let's break down the concept of \"Overfitting\" in Machine Learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Overfitting?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data *too well*.  Instead of learning the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, it memorizes the specific examples, including the noise and outliers present in the training set.  As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but performs poorly on new, unseen data (also known as the test data or validation data).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it this way:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're teaching a student about animals. You only show them pictures of three specific dogs: a golden retriever named Buddy, a poodle named Fifi, and a German shepherd named Rex.  If the student overfits, they might learn that all dogs *must* be golden, fluffy, or have pointy ears.  When they see a Dalmatian, they might not recognize it as a dog because it doesn't fit the specific characteristics they learned from the limited training set.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics of Overfitting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **High Accuracy on Training Data:** The model achieves very high accuracy (or low error) when evaluated on the data it was trained on.\n",
      "*   **Low Accuracy on Test/Validation Data:** The model performs significantly worse on new, unseen data.  This is the key indicator of overfitting.\n",
      "*   **Complex Model:** Overfitted models are often overly complex, with too many parameters or features. They try to capture every nuance of the training data, even the irrelevant ones.\n",
      "*   **Poor Generalization:** The model fails to generalize well to new, real-world scenarios. It's too specific to the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Does Overfitting Happen?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several factors can contribute to overfitting:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Small Training Dataset:**  If the training dataset is too small, the model might learn the specific characteristics of that limited set, rather than the general patterns.\n",
      "*   **Noisy Data:**  If the training data contains a lot of noise (errors, outliers, irrelevant information), the model might learn to fit that noise, leading to overfitting.\n",
      "*   **Overly Complex Model:**  Using a model that is too complex for the amount of data available can lead to overfitting.  Complex models have more parameters to adjust, making them more prone to memorizing the training data.\n",
      "*   **Training for Too Long:**  Training a model for too many epochs (iterations) can also lead to overfitting.  The model might start to memorize the training data after a certain point.\n",
      "*   **Irrelevant Features:** Including irrelevant or redundant features in the training data can confuse the model and lead to overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Detect Overfitting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Train/Test Split:** The most common method is to split your data into a training set and a test (or validation) set. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set. A significant difference in performance between the two sets indicates overfitting.\n",
      "*   **Cross-Validation:** Cross-validation is a more robust technique than a simple train/test split. It involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on some folds, and testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times, and the results are averaged to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n",
      "*   **Learning Curves:** Plotting learning curves (training error and validation error as a function of training data size) can help identify overfitting.  If the training error is much lower than the validation error, and the gap between them is increasing, it's a sign of overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Prevent Overfitting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several techniques to combat overfitting:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Increase Training Data:**  The best way to prevent overfitting is often to simply get more training data.  A larger dataset allows the model to learn more general patterns and reduces the impact of noise.\n",
      "*   **Feature Selection/Engineering:** Carefully select the most relevant features and engineer new features that capture the underlying relationships in the data.  Remove irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
      "*   **Regularization:** Regularization techniques add a penalty to the model's complexity, discouraging it from learning overly complex patterns. Common regularization methods include L1 regularization (Lasso), L2 regularization (Ridge), and Elastic Net.\n",
      "*   **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters to prevent overfitting.\n",
      "*   **Simplify the Model:**  Use a simpler model with fewer parameters.  For example, if you're using a decision tree, limit its depth.  If you're using a neural network, reduce the number of layers or neurons.\n",
      "*   **Early Stopping:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training. Stop training when the validation error starts to increase, even if the training error is still decreasing. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.\n",
      "*   **Dropout (for Neural Networks):** Dropout is a regularization technique specific to neural networks. It randomly drops out (deactivates) some neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.\n",
      "*   **Data Augmentation:**  Create new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data (e.g., rotating, scaling, or cropping images). This can help the model generalize better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Overfitting is a critical issue in machine learning that can lead to poor performance on new data. By understanding the causes of overfitting and using appropriate techniques to prevent it, you can build models that generalize well and perform reliably in real-world scenarios.

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

       "The design philosophy of Python emphasizes being a multi-paradigm programming language that fully supports object-oriented and structured programming, while also incorporating features that support functional and aspect-oriented programming. It is designed to be a 'glue language,' meaning it can easily integrate components written in other languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key aspects of its design philosophy include:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Extensibility:** Python is designed to be highly extensible through modules, rather than having all functionality built into its core. This allows for a compact core language with a large standard library.\n",
       "*   **Dynamic Typing and Name Resolution:** It uses dynamic typing and resolves method and variable names during program execution (late binding).\n",
       "*   **Memory Management:** Python employs a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.\n",
       "*   **Vision of Small Core, Large Library:** The vision for Python, stemming from frustrations with the ABC language, was to have a small core language complemented by a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter."

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
