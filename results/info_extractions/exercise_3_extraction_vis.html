Quality but exhaus.ng 

I&#x27;m a big fan of Nolan&#x27;s work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there 
would be some ﬂipping in .melines and I&#x27;d need to concentrate. I didn&#x27;t ﬁnd this to 
be a problem at all and <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the storytelling was beau.fully done</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The ac.ng was 
universally excellent</span>. I saw a review saying <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt was rather OTT</span> but I didn&#x27;t 
ﬁnd that at all. 

I think my biggest gripe with the ﬁlm may mean that I&#x27;m just geFng old. I found <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the 
direc.on quite jarring with jump cuts galore</span>. While it did keep things moving along 
apace, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it was all rather exhaus.ng</span>. I also found <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the music and sound very very loud 
to the point of intrusion</span>. Much like other Nolan ﬁlms as it goes: Interstellar that I 
love, also had *very* loud music. 

All in all <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this is a quality watch</span>. It just <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">leN me longing for the days when so called 
&#x27;cerebral&#x27; biopics, were a liOle more tranquil</span>. 

And the Oscar goes to... 
I&#x27;m s.ll collec.ng my thoughts aNer experiencing this ﬁlm, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cillian Murphy might as 
well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This ﬁlm is a masterclass in weaving narra.ves and diﬀerent .me periods while 
exploring the profound depths of a man whose ac.ons altered the world&#x27;s trajectory 
forever, for beOer or worse</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nolan brings us into the complexi.es of Oppenheimer, 
and all the moral conﬂicts s.rring within him</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Murphy&#x27;s portrayal is so rive.ng</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the long run-.me became an aNerthought</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Robert Downey Jr also oﬀers a great performance</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nolan&#x27;s push and pull with 
how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top</span>. 

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">any 
ﬁlm lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this ﬁlm for hours on end</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">A brilliantly layered examina.on of a man throughout all of his incredible 
accomplishments and fundamental ﬂaws</span> 

&quot;Oppenheimer&quot; is a biographical thriller ﬁlm wriOen and directed by Christopher 
Nolan (&quot;The Dark Knight trilogy&quot;, &quot;Incep.on&quot;, &quot;Interstellar&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;), based on the 
biography &quot;American Prometheus&quot; by Kai Bird and Mar.n J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Murphy in the lead role, in addi.on to MaO Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, 
and Florence Pugh, it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered 
examina.on of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and 
fundamental ﬂaws</span>. 

During the height of the Second World War, theore.cal physicist J. Robert 
Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to 
oversee the &quot;ManhaOan Project&quot;, a top secret opera.on intended to develop the 
world&#x27;s ﬁrst nuclear weapons. ANer becoming acquainted with the project&#x27;s director 
Major General Leslie Groves (MaO Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to 
an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert 
of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scien.sts and their families are 
brought in to this discreet loca.on, Oppenheimer works .relessly around the clock to 
build this weapon of mass destruc.on before the Nazis can devise their own. With 
the War raging and personal troubles moun.ng, Oppenheimer con.nues to push 
himself to his utmost limits, but soon suﬀers the consequences of his dedica.on. 

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb &quot;LiOle Boy&quot; was dropped on the Japanese city 
of Hiroshima, making it the ﬁrst .me a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. 
The dropping of this bomb and &quot;Fat Man&quot; in Nagasaki three days later was what 
essen.ally brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era 
known as the &quot;Atomic Age&quot;. To this day, it remains a conten.ous topic of discussion 
among many as to whether the ethical ramiﬁca.ons of these bombings are jus.ﬁed 
by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the 
blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these 
weapons led to him being credited as &quot;the father of the atomic bomb&quot;, a label which 
he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biopic 
&quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, we are treated to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an intricately structured and uniquely tragic 
analysis of this complex man&#x27;s legacy</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">how it s.ll aﬀects everyone several 
decades later</span>. 

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conven.onal biopic but 
rather as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fragmented, non-sequen.al series of highlights pertaining to the .tle 
subject&#x27;s life</span>. When we are ﬁrst introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he 
is an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">incredibly intelligent man</span> whose <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">sheer commitment to his craN earns him the 
utmost respect of many of his peers</span>, even as a young student. However, almost 
immediately aNer, the ﬁlm cuts to him on trial for allegedly having .es to 
communism, an accusa.on which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">threatens to completely derail the posi.ve</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
reputa.on bestowed upon him. As the judicial commiOee interrogates him with hard 
hiFng ques.ons, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement</span>, 
shown to the audience through ﬂashbacks of varying length to pivotal .mes in his 
life. These scenes range from his fractured rela.onship with his wife to the remorse 
he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">gives the viewer a ﬁrst person 
perspec.ve of what Oppenheimer&#x27;s mind must have been processing</span> during this 
intense period of his life, as he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">contemplates the very real possibility of having all of 
his hard work mi.gated by these powerful government oﬃcials</span>. It&#x27;s hard to imagine 
any other director trying to convey so much informa.on to their audience in such a 
fashion, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">always 
striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an 
imperfect man</span>. 

Another notable thing about Nolan&#x27;s direc.on is his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">resourcefulness in the way he 
handles certain important scenes</span>. One moment, which I won&#x27;t speak about in too 
much detail, literally <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">had me on the edge of my seat</span> as we watch Oppenheimer and 
the rest of the scien.sts test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to 
be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in 
his movies, he instead opts for more prac.<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">cal methods of showing the increasing 
power of these bombs</span>. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be 
working on their own weapon of mass destruc.on, there is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a real sense of urgency</span> 
ﬂowing throughout these scenes, giving the scien.sts all the more reason to work 
even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">each bomb explodes, it can be 
likened to a</span> .cking clock, with each blast represen.ng progression towards the end 
goal of perfec.ng the ul.mate weapon. The crea.ve <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">use of edi.ng during these 
scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace</span>, something especially necessary 
considering the ﬁlm&#x27;s three hour run.me. Nolan previously exhibited a similar 
method in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, which u.lised the ﬁlm&#x27;s score in a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">clever way to show 
the audience how</span> .me is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">clever 
way around taking the easy route of using CG</span> eﬀects to tell a story, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">keeps 
viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial</span> proﬁciency. 

For what can only be described as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the performance of his career</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cillian Murphy 
brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer</span>, a man so complex 
that I can&#x27;t imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this eﬀec.vely. The 
combined eﬀorts of both Murphy&#x27;s ac.ng and Nolan&#x27;s direc.on help make 
Oppenheimer <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the most</span> fascina.ng individuals of the 20th century. This is not 
a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">so many layers to his</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 4**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
character that it bears an in-depth explora.on that only a movie like this can 
accomplish. The ﬁlm paints Oppenheimer as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a 
complicated man</span> whose human quali.es undermine what he will be remembered 
for in the history books. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian ﬁgure, 
rife with ﬂaws, haugh.ness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable 
fate.</span> One scene <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the ﬁeld of nuclear 
physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his 
family.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat</span> for the way in 
which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conﬂict in history, while 
consequently ushering in something even worse. 

The rest of the ﬁlm&#x27;s cast <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all did a fantas.c job</span> as well, with the standouts being MaO 
Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon&#x27;s take on Major 
General Leslie Groves is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">more than simply that of a stock military character but rather 
an important ﬁgure</span> who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer&#x27;s talents to his 
advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, oNen 
ques.oning the ramiﬁca.ons of the theore.cal nature in experimen.ng with nuclear 
power. Groves&#x27;s ignorance to Oppenheimer&#x27;s extensive scien.ﬁc knowledge <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">allows 
the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail.</span> To that 
eﬀect, he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">provides an important third party perspec.ve</span> to Oppenheimer&#x27;s 
achievements. 

It&#x27;s also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">great to see Robert Downey Jr shine</span> as Lewis Strauss, which is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">not only his 
best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general.</span> Strauss is a man who is not 
viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer&#x27;s .es to 
communism. He <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can prac.cally 
consider him the true villain of this story.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Downey takes every opportunity to show 
Strauss&#x27;s two-faced nature</span>, biding his .me for the right moment to strip 
Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputa.on. Reportedly, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Downey considers this his best role to date</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it deﬁnitely seems like he is puFng 
everything he has into his performance</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed signiﬁcantly</span> as KiOy Oppenheimer 
and Jean Tatlock, respec.vely. Each of these two women represent something 
signiﬁcant in Oppenheimer&#x27;s life, with KiOy being who he should be with and Jean 
being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of 
Oppenheimer choosing between ac.ng on ins.nct or ac.ng on intellect when 
assis.ng in the construc.on of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
ﬂawed human quali.es. It can be diﬃcult to give up following your heart but when 
the fate of the world rests on your pragma.c decision making, some.mes you have 
no other choice. 

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan ﬁlm, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">&quot;Oppenheimer&quot; exceeds virtually all 
expecta.ons to become one of the very best in both ﬁelds</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There are few ﬁlms that 
are able to tackle such subject maOer in this much detail while also remaining 
entertaining the whole way through</span>. I guess some.mes all it takes is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one brave, risk-
taking ﬁlmmaker</span> to prove that this really is a possible task. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="60" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">We need more ﬁlms like 
this to inspire thoughkul, crea.ve discussion</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="61" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it is comfor.ng to know that 
someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream</span>. ANer all, it&#x27;s a 
tough job, but someone&#x27;s got to do it for us.
